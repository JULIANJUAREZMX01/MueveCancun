# CancúnMueve - AI Context & Development Rules

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18+ (TSX), Vite, Tailwind CSS v4.
- **Routing Engine**: Rust compiled to WebAssembly (WASM).
- **Maps**: Mapbox GL JS.
- **PWA**: Service Workers (Offline-first), IndexedDB.

## Core Principles
1. **Offline-first**: All route calculations MUST happen locally via WASM. Do not rely on external APIs for routing.
2. **High Contrast UI**: The app will be used under intense sunlight. Use the `sunny-mode` palette defined in `index.css`.
3. **Data Integrity**: Use `src/data/master_routes.json` as the source of truth for R1, R2, and R10.
4. **Performance**: Minimal bundle size, optimized WASM calls, and lazy loading for map components.

## Development Workflows
- WASM functions should be small and focused on heavy math (Dijkstra, Haversine).
- UI components should use semantic HTML and Tailwind utility classes.
- Use `lucide-react` for iconography.

## TypeScript Standards
- No `any` types.
- Strict interface definitions for Routes and Stops.
- Use `Zod` or similar if validation is needed for crowdsourced data later.
